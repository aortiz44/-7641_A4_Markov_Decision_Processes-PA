There are 2 parts to this code. The first part is the Forest Management Problem which you can run by executing
ForestManagement.py. This function will create different graphs located in the SaveFigures Directory. Most of them have
a sub folder. The only one that does not have a sub folder is the rolling averages.
The Next part is to run the MDPExample.py file. This file will run the experiment for the Policy and Value Iterations,
this function will also call the OtherExample.py and fun the Q-Learning algorithm. The Policy and Value images are
saved in the Frozen lake directory the Q-Learning are saved under the OtherExample Directory.


I created a virtual environment for this assignment through Anaconda.
A tar file of the environment can be found as well as the list of packages used to run the program.
The package list for this environment can be found here in this directory called "package-list.txt"

To run the virtual environment, unzip the environment and run the activate command from the command prompt
the activate command can be found in the bin folder, or in the Scripts folder.
my_env/bin/activate
my_env/Scripts/activate
